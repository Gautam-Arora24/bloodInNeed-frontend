### What is Blood In Need?
Blood In Need is an effort to make donation of blood easier. Any user can request a donor available in his/her city with same blood group and the donor would be sent a request in real time. I have tried my hard to make this website easy to use. Any ideas, suggestions or bug reports, reach me out to on my social media handles. Peace!!!

### Further Improvements
1) I need to add map to show the user exact locations of donors
2) Need to convert this site to PWA
